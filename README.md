# Uniform-Cubic-B-Spline
This repository contains a Unity project that showcases the implementation and visualization of Uniform Cubic B-Splines with various easing functions. It's a helpful tool for understanding and experimenting with spline curves, especially in the context of animations and motion graphics within Unity.

## Deployment
The application is deployed and accessible [here](https://wyatt-drew.github.io/Uniform-Cubic-B-Spline/index.html).
